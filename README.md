# spooky-days-twitter-iac
I created this AWS serverless application while I was preparing for the AWS Developer Associate and Terraform Associate certifications to validate the knowledge and experience I've gained on the job. This application is sunset. The associated AWS and Terraform Cloud accounts have been closed, and the CI/CD options (Jenkins/GitHub Actions) are disabled so no costs can accrue.

A serverless Python app that generates an image of various "National Days" with a spooky twist using OpenAPI's DALL E 3 engine and posts to Twitter (X) on a daily cron schedule.

This repository contains the infrastructure created using Terraform. The application code repo can be found at https://github.com/allenac86/spooky-days-twitter
